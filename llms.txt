## Project
Quantum Vault is a production-grade, client-side post-quantum encryption
application. It runs entirely in the browser with zero server-side code,
zero data collection, and zero tracking.

## Purpose
Provide accessible, educational, and production-ready post-quantum
cryptographic tools including:
- Key generation (X-Wing hybrid KEM, ML-DSA-65 signatures)
- File encryption / decryption (X-Wing + HKDF-SHA256 + AES-256-GCM)
- Message signing / verification (ML-DSA-65, NIST FIPS 204)

## Architecture
- Single-page application: index.html (markup + inline CSS) + main.js (logic)
- External dependency: @noble/post-quantum v0.5.2 loaded from esm.sh CDN
- All cryptography: Web Crypto API + @noble/post-quantum (client-side only)
- Hosting: Static file hosting (Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages)

## Cryptographic Algorithms
- X-Wing Hybrid KEM: ML-KEM-768 (FIPS 203) + X25519, combined with SHA3-256
  - IND-CCA2 secure, 128-bit classical + post-quantum safe
  - IETF draft standard
- ML-DSA-65 (Dilithium): NIST FIPS 204, Category 3 (~192-bit security)
  - EUF-CMA secure, post-quantum resistant
- AES-256-GCM: FIPS 197, authenticated encryption (AEAD)
  - Post-quantum safe (Grover reduces to 128-bit, still secure)
- HKDF-SHA256: RFC 5869, key derivation with random salt + domain separator

## Encryption Flow
1. X-Wing encapsulates shared secret using recipient public key
2. HKDF-SHA256 derives AES-256 key from shared secret
3. AES-256-GCM encrypts file data with random 12-byte nonce
4. SHA-256 plaintext hash computed for integrity verification
5. Output: .pqenc JSON package (version 2.0)

## Security Posture
- Content Security Policy: script-src 'self' https://esm.sh (no unsafe-inline for scripts)
- HTTP security headers: HSTS, X-Frame-Options DENY, COOP, COEP, CORP
- No cookies, localStorage, analytics, or tracking
- All keys exist only in browser memory during session
- RFC 9116 security.txt for vulnerability disclosure

## Compliance Alignment
- NIST post-quantum standards (FIPS 203, FIPS 204)
- OWASP security headers best practices
- RFC 9116 (security.txt)
- Privacy by design (zero data collection)
